If I were to start a software company along with a few partners from my current group I'd choose Nikita and Soumith who are Reliable and Trustworthy with the assignment, And instead of having partners with same skillset which might lead conflict of choices at times id choose my friends who have a different skillset than that of mine but compliment the skills I've got. This way I can tick all the boxes required which  is crucial in success of a software company. 
I believe I am a Resilient leader and I believe I'm good at both technical and managemt so I need one person who is a professional  in technical department (Nikitha) and one person who is a major in management (Soumith). This provides a proper body to the company and establishes great communication between the members. I've already worked with Nikita and Soumith on my previous projects so communication is already well established. We all share similar passion and goals which sticks us together in ups and downs. 
Individually Soumith is Great Problem solver  and an expert in conflict resolution. He can be a great asset In the managerial side of things he is a natural  and His industry knowledge and fiscal responsibility is like icing on the cake.
My other partner Nikita is a highly motivated and passionate individual who has abundance of technical skills like Python, Machine Learning, Cloud computing and Web development. Her Creativity can be a game changer and she exactly knows what a company needs.
